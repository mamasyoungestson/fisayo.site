## About Kin

### Project Goals

Given there was a lack of digital resources that solved problems related to child adoption. Kin aims to provide a better way for people to complete the adoption process by:

1\. Enabling easy, safe and fluid interaction between birth parents, families, agencies and more.

2\. Providing information, support and access professionals and experts throughout the whole adoption process.

With this Kin wants to play a major part in finding every child a home and overcome the problem of the decreasing adoption success rates throughout the world.


## 01 Learn — Research & Analysis

![](/upload/Kin/Learn.png)

### Understanding Perceptions

By analyzing available data I already began conceiving possible solutions. It was important that I first better understand how individuals (users — parents, families, adoption institutions ) perceived the adoption process. I create and test out ideas and assumptions through users' perceptions of adoptions. To achieve this I used interviews and surveys creatively.

Information gathered and interpreted echoed most of the information analyzed from reports, surveys, studies, numerical data, etc. As mentioned before, now I have a deeper understanding of the process and how to use available technology to make my best guesses and assumptions which I will be able to test.

## 02 Think — Ideation

From the analysis, it was my goal to understand the climate of the adoption process (focusing on the problems and challenges) and the perception of individuals towards adoptions.

To highlight the challenges:

**-** Adoption felt like a very long process

**-** There is a lack of exposure to information and support regarding adoptions. Individuals expressed lack of knowledge, confusion, nervousness, and fear of the adoption process

**-** Individuals who were invested in the adoption process illustrated feelings of overwhelm and anxiety

### Formulating Solutions

I aimed to come up with solutions that could be tested and iterated upon as soon as possible (a bulk of visual designs solutions were completed within a week). The process involved sketches, user experience architecture and visual strategy (user journeys, micro design systems, wireframes, prototypes).

### Designing The System

This process involved modular building of various parts of the system. When beginning a design system, there can be a need to start designing components, but components are designed elements composed of a cumulation of decisions that need to be defined first. When starting a design system, experience has taught me that starting with the foundation variables propels the system forward and acts as the building blocks which most of the system is built upon. The foundation variables include text sizes, colors, typography, spacing, etc.

#### Color

The adoption process can be scary and I created a color palette that would provide a mood to counteract that fearful feeling most people don't want to experience during the adoption process. I wanted to communicate that Kin will make the adoption process exciting and a joyous experience while also providing the best support along the way.

#### Typography

Kin needed typefaces that would be functional and appropriate with the current design communication. After exploration and testing, we chose the beautiful Abril Fatface and simple yet elegant Circular Std.

#### Iconography

The iconography style needed to unify with the current design direction and be able to be used in various use cases.

#### Design Components

The component design structure needed to be as versatile as possible to cover many use cases. As mentioned before, the importance of setting the foundation variables first allowed me to make informed and structured design decisions that matched the design direction and were in line with solving the user needs and project goals.

## 03 Test

### Design To Test Early

Our goal was to design and test solutions as early as possible. User testing enabled us to figure out what worked and what didn't work. It provided great insight into the mind of the user and allowed us to focus on solving important user problems and challenges.
