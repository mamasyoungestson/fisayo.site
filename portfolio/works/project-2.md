## 01 Learn — Research & Analysis

### Understanding Perceptions

By analyzing available data I already began conceiving possible solutions. It was important that I first better understand how individuals (users — parents, families, adoption institutions ) perceived the adoption process. I create and test out ideas and assumptions through users' perceptions of the adoption process. To achieve this I used interviews and surveys creatively.

**_Tools Used_**

1\. User interviews — In adoption-related forums, adoptions agencies, finding answers to questions FAQs

2\. Surveys — Also through adoption-related forums

Information gathered and interpreted echoed most of the information analyzed from reports, surveys, studies, numerical data, etc. As mentioned before, now I have a deeper understanding of the process and how to use available technology to make my best guesses and assumptions which I will be able to test.
