## About Kin

### Project Goals

Given there was a lack of resources that solved problems related to child adoption. Kin aims to provide a better way for people to complete the adoption process by:

1\. Enabling easy, safe and fluid interaction between birth parents, families, agencies and more.

2\. Providing information, support and access specialized to professionals and experts throughout the whole adoption process.

With this Kin wants to play a major part in finding every child a home and overcome the problem of the decreasing adoption success rates throughout the world.

## 01 Learn — Research & Analysis

### Understanding Perceptions

By analyzing available data I already began conceiving possible solutions. It was important that I first better understand how individuals (users — parents, families, adoption institutions ) perceived the adoption process. I create and test out ideas and assumptions through users' perceptions of the adoption process. To achieve this I used interviews and surveys creatively.

Information gathered and interpreted echoed most of the information analyzed from reports, surveys, studies, numerical data, etc. As mentioned before, now I have a deeper understanding of the process and how to use available technology to make my best guesses and assumptions which I will be able to test.

## 02 Think — Ideation

From the analysis, it was my goal to understand the climate of the adoption process (focusing on the problems and challenges) and the perception of individuals towards.

To highlight the challenges:

**-** Adoption felt like a very long process

**-** There is a lack of exposure to information and support regarding adoptions. Individuals expressed lack of knowledge, confusion, nervousness, and fear of the adoption process

**-** Individuals who were invested in the adoption process illustrated feelings of overwhelm and anxiety

### Formulating Solutions

My aim was to come up with solutions that could be tested and iterated upon as soon as possible (a bulk of visual designs solutions were completed within a week). The process involved sketches, wireframes, micro design systems, highly functional prototypes.
