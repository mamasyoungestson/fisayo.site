## About Kin

### Project Goals

Given there was a lack of resources that solved problems related to child adoption. Kin aims to provide a better way for people to complete the adoption process by:

* Enabling easy, safe and fluid interaction between birth parents, families, agencies and more.
* Providing information, support and access specialized to professionals and experts throughout the whole adoption process.

With this Kin wants to play a major part in finding every child a home and overcome the problem of the decreasing adoption success rates throughout the world.
