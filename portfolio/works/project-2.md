## About Kin

### Project Goals

Given there was a lack of resources that solved problems related to child adoption. Kin aims to provide a better way for people to complete the adoption process by:

1\. Enabling easy, safe and fluid interaction between birth parents, families, agencies and more.

2\. Providing information, support and access specialized to professionals and experts throughout the whole adoption process.

With this Kin wants to play a major part in finding every child a home and overcome the problem of the decreasing adoption success rates throughout the world.

## 01 Learn — Research & Analysis

Available data gave insight into the state of adoption domestically for the U.S. and globally. U.S Department of State provides data that shows there has been a decline in the number of adoptions in the U.S and globally in recent years (about 13 years). In the U.S the AFCARS Report #26 reports hundreds of thousands of children in foster care/or waiting to be adopted.

With further investigation, more key issues (financial, health, legal) were highlighted that can be condensed into the lack of information and support during the adoption process. The lack of conveying reliable and accessible information and support causes individuals to remain in ignorance and fear about adoptions, hence the decrease in adoption rates. It should also be noted that data has shown not only are adoption rates decreasing but there is a corresponding increase in the number of children being admitted into financial institutions like foster care. The problems are very much visible.

### Understanding Perceptions

By analyzing available data I already began conceiving possible solutions. It was important that I first better understand how individuals (users — parents, families, adoption institutions ) perceived the adoption process. I create and test out ideas and assumptions through users' perceptions of the adoption process. To achieve this I used most widely known tools with a bit of craftiness.

**_Tools Used_**

1\. User interviews — In adoption-related forums, adoptions agencies, finding questions to answers in FAQs

2\. Surveys — Also through adoption-related forums
