It aims to inform and empower individuals to take control of their health (which is physical, mental and spiritual) and make better health decisions with a fun, calm, no-pressure approach.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/WellThumbnail.jpg" alt=""></p> <hr> <h2 id="about-kin">About Kin</h2> <h3 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h3> <p>Well aims to focus on providing holistic health information to empowers individuals to take control of health and make better choices for their well being. Studies show an increase in major illnesses like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular-related diseases which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Well wants to affect people's daily lives and habits and improve health worldwide.</p> <h2 id="_01-research-analysis">01 Research &amp; Analysis</h2> <p>There are copious data and information regarding health. It was important to gather reliable and relevant information while also being able to streamline and converge the needed data. There are a lot of health issues in the U.S. and globally. There are a lot of positives when it comes to health and health care, however, there are issues that still need to be addressed. Obesity, diabetes, and heart-related diseases are examples of major diseases that have been on the <a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rise for the last 30 years<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> and are the leading causes of death annually. Despite spending billions of dollars spent each year, the population has not seen major improvements in preventing such diseases.</p> <p>Information shows that diet, alcohol, physical activities affects the risk of certain diseases. Holistic health provides practices that help in all areas of a person's life that lead to better health. Over the last few years, there has been more time and money invested in holistic and alternative medicine. People are more accepting of new forms of treatment and information on health. Numbers have shown that holistic treatment is more affordable than it's conventional counterpart.</p> <p>The main concern is better health for everyone. Well does not want to replace health care, it wants to help provide holistic health solutions to individuals that are accessible and affordable for people's modern lives.</p> <h3 id="understanding-the-user">Understanding The User</h3> <p>The plan was to get regarding users and their values. I needed to ask the right questions during discussions with the user to get an understanding as to how users' day to day activities and how these activities play major roles in their current state of health. Are they conscious of their health? How do they manage stress? What is their level of income? How do they spend their free time? What do they prefer ordering take out or home-cooked meals? The aim is to create digital solutions that would seamlessly integrate with different personalities and the day to day activities of the user.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/WellUserDiscussions.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="photoInfo">
User discussions
</p><p></p> <hr> <h2 id="_02-ideate">02 Ideate</h2> <h3 id="user-experience-architecture-visual-strategy">User Experience Architecture &amp; Visual Strategy</h3> <p>The entire design structure followed a design system where the UX architecture and UI focused heavily on design system elements and their functionality. The design system served as the building blocks for the creation of wireframes and functional prototypes. Information architecture was very important to know the layout of the application and how the user interacts with the information. The goal was to provide an experience that was easy to use, functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p> <h3 id="designing-the-system">Designing The System</h3> <p>I first began with the base variables that lay the main structure for the system. The foundation allows me to make better design decisions moving forward and makes it easier to build design components. Color, typography, grid, and spacing, etc are the variables for the foundation elements.</p> <h4 id="color">Color</h4> <p>The main color palette used in Well defined the main pages, headers, screen background, and body text and many of the design elements. The colors chosen were used to communicate a happy, joyous, calm and health-promoting mood. We want the users to feel great engaging with the app. Also, we want them to feel that they are making a positive impact in their lives as they make changes for their mind, body, and spirit through de-stressing, nutrition, exercise, valuable health information and much more.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/Colors.jpg" alt=""></p> <h4 id="typography">Typography</h4> <p>We needed a typography hierarchy that promoted a happy and calm design communication. By experimenting with various typefaces, we settled with Playfair Display (used to communicate fun and happiness) with Avenir LT Std (used to communicate simplicity and calmness).</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/Typography.jpg" alt=""></p> <h4 id="grid-spacing">Grid &amp; Spacing</h4> <p>For the grid and spacing, I proposed using an 8px grid, using multiples of 8 to define dimensions, padding, and margin of elements. With more detailed adjustments, a 4px spacing rule was adopted. It was very important that elements aligned but vertically and horizontally. The grid layout consisted of 24px margins and 8px gutter. Although, with these rules sometimes exceptions are needed.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/GridSystem.png" alt=""></p> <h4 id="design-components">Design Components</h4> <p>The components in the design system were vital in creating the main elements users were going to interact with. The elements had to be extensive so they could serve many use cases. The also had to be consistent and easy to scale (the importance of why I build the foundation variables first).</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/Components.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="photoInfo">

The wireframes were translated into early concept prototypes that users tested.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/WireframeUserJourney.png" alt=""></p><p class="photoInfo">

We used developed prototypes while observing users as they used the product. The purpose was to gain a deeper understanding of the user and test hypotheses earlier on in the design process rather than later. Prototypes were tested with first-time users to observe a fresh communication between the users and the app. We also decided to re-test with repeat users to see how well we improved in our solutions and of course re-test assumptions.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Well/TestEarly.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="photoInfo">
