Kin aims to provide a better way for people to complete the adoption process by:</p> <p>1. Enabling easy, safe and fluid interaction between birth parents, families, agencies and more.</p> <p>2. Providing information, support and access professionals and experts throughout the whole adoption process.</p> <p>With this Kin wants to play a major part in finding every child a home and overcome the problem of the decreasing adoption success rates throughout the world.</p> <h2 id="_01-learn-research-analysis">01 Learn — Research &amp; Analysis</h2> <p>There is reliable information that paints a vivid picture of the state of the adoption process. Adoption rates have been steadily decreasing in the U.S. and globally since 2005. Data shows that a decrease in adoption rates has a corresponding increase in the number of children placed for adoptions.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/Data1.jpg" alt=""> <img src="/upload/Kin/Data2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p class="photoInfo">
Some important information used in research 
</p> <p>Understanding some reports from senior officials of adoption organizations, several factors have affected adoption rates such as costs, laws, health, ethical issues, and much more. From my standpoint, I could agree with this. Before embarking on this project my perception of adoption was completely different from was it is now. You can say I was ignorant and even fearful of the process but now I am much more informed and confident about the adoption process. Sometimes I feel like I can give a lecture on this topic. Despite that, I still view adoptions as a very big step and an important step in someone's life and can be very intimidating. I needed to understand the perceptions of individuals to come up with solutions to make adoption rates more successful.</p> <h3 id="understanding-perceptions">Understanding Perceptions</h3> <p>By analyzing available data I already began conceiving possible solutions. It was important that I first better understand how individuals (users — parents, families, adoption institutions) perceived the adoption process. I create and test out ideas and assumptions through users' perceptions of adoptions. To achieve this I used interviews and surveys creatively.</p> <p>Information gathered and interpreted echoed most of the information analyzed from reports, surveys, studies, numerical data, etc. Through investigation, it was important to now target the major types of users that would be using the application. There were major personas to consider for various use cases of the application.</p> <h4 id="user-personas">User Personas</h4> <p><strong>A.</strong> Individuals who are invested in the adoption process but are new to the whole process. These individuals are most times uninformed, afraid, confused, unsure, etc.
<strong>B.</strong> Individuals who are invested in the adoption process but have done it in the past either successfully or unsuccessfully. These individuals are most times often better informed.
<strong>C.</strong> Individuals that are uninterested or have not given much thought to adoptions. How can Kin make adoptions more attractive and increase the number of people interested and taking steps towards adoptions.</p> <hr> <h2 id="_02-think-ideation">02 Think — Ideation</h2> <p>From the analysis, it was my goal to understand the adoption process (focusing on the problems and challenges) and the perception of individuals towards adoptions.</p> <p>To highlight the challenges:</p> <p><strong>-</strong> Adoption felt like a very long process — on average, it can take up to 2 years to complete the adoption process</p> <p><strong>-</strong> There is a lack of exposure to information and support regarding adoptions. Individuals expressed lack of knowledge, confusion, nervousness, and fear of the adoption process</p> <p><strong>-</strong> Individuals who were invested in the adoption process illustrated feelings of overwhelm and anxiety</p> <h3 id="formulating-solutions">Formulating Solutions</h3> <p>I aimed to come up with solutions that could be tested and iterated upon as soon as possible (a bulk of visual designs solutions were completed within a week). The process involved sketches, user experience architecture and visual strategy (user journeys, micro design systems, wireframes, prototypes).</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/wireframes2-1.png" alt=""></p> <h3 id="designing-the-system">Designing The System</h3> <p>This process involved modular building of various parts of the system. When beginning a design system, there can be a need to start designing components, but components are designed elements composed of a cumulation of decisions that need to be defined first. When starting a design system, experience has taught me that starting with the foundation variables propels the system forward and acts as the building blocks which most of the system is built upon. The foundation variables include text sizes, colors, typography, spacing, etc.</p> <h4 id="color">Color</h4> <p>The adoption process can be scary and I created a color palette that would provide a mood to counteract that fearful feeling most people don't want to experience during the adoption process. I wanted to communicate that Kin will make the adoption process exciting and a joyous experience while also providing the best support along the way.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/DesigningTheSystem1.jpg" alt=""></p> <h4 id="typography">Typography</h4> <p>Kin needed typefaces that would be functional and appropriate with the current design communication. After exploration and testing, we chose the beautiful Abril Fatface and simple yet elegant Circular Std.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/DesigningTheSystem2.jpg" alt=""></p> <h4 id="iconography">Iconography</h4> <p>The iconography style needed to unify with the current design direction and be able to be used in various use cases.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/DesigningTheSystem3.jpg" alt=""></p> <h4 id="design-components">Design Components</h4> <p>The component design structure needed to be as versatile as possible to cover many use cases. As mentioned before, the importance of setting the foundation variables first allowed me to make informed and structured design decisions that matched the design direction and were in line with solving the user needs and project goals.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/Components.jpg" alt=""></p> <hr> <h2 id="_03-test">03 Test</h2> <h3 id="design-to-test-early">Design To Test Early</h3> <p>Our goal was to design and test solutions as early as possible. User testing enabled us to figure out what worked and what didn't work. It provided great insight into the mind of the user and allowed us to focus on solving important user problems and challenges.</p> <p><img src="/upload/Kin/DesignFastTestEarly.jpg" alt=""></p> <hr> <h2 id="design-solutions">Design Solutions</h2> <p>Our solutions for the major challenges can be broken down into two categories mainly:</p> <p>1. <strong>Connection Solution</strong>: It aims to solve the issue of time and connects prospective adoptive parents/families with the child and birth parents with adoptive families. Users set up profiles with and the back-end matches parents and families together based on criteria and takes care of state-mandated/country-mandated background checks. It connects families and parents in a quicker, safe and secure digital environment with the help of modern technology. We do also aim that the accessibility and speed of the connection will attract more people to the viability of adoptions and make the process less painful and easier for parents and families. The connection solution also aims to lead to more safe and secure physical connections as well.</p> <p>2. <strong>Support Solution</strong>: As mentioned earlier there are issues with the amount of exposure to information about the adoption process. The support solution provides information, guidance and important services needed for a successful adoption process. We make all information easy and accessible by seamlessly integrating help and support for our users into there daily lives. With the support solution, users can access information in the form of articles, blogs, videos, and guides. Users have quick access to professionals such as doctors, lawyers, financial planners, etc. Features we plan on releasing soon is a personal &quot;concierge&quot; for the adoption and build a strong community where individuals can help answer questions, share their experiences, and help offer support.</p> <p><strong>These solutions are the best guess solutions. We are constantly getting feedback and testing our decisions to offer the best experience and solutions for our users and ultimately help improve adoptions.</strong></p> <video autoplay="autoplay" playsinline="" loop="loop" muted="muted" crossorigin="anonymous"><source src="/upload/Kin/OnboardingPresentationForWebsite(3-31-2020).mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <video autoplay="autoplay" playsinline="" loop="loop" muted="muted" crossorigin="anonymous"><source src="/upload/Kin/ConnectForWebsite(3-31-2020).mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <p class="photoInfo"><b>Connection Solution:</b> Empowering birth parents, adoptive families, and adoption institutions to easily and accessibility connect.
